    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Who on Earth am I?</h2>
    <p>Greetings! My name is Ephram Matocha, I am a 14 year-old student based in Poole, Dorset. I am a big-time space
        fanatic so as a response to that I had an idea to make a website. So I have. I shall now move on to the aim of
        the website as well as content because this website isn't about
        me: its about space. It's all about space.</p>
    <h3>The Higher Purpose of this Humble Website</h3>
    <p>With the help of a good friend, I created this website with the aim to help teach certain things that might not
        necessarily be taught (such as dyson spheres). My aim is to help educate people about all-things space-related
        that don't get taught in school. That's all from me for now. I hope you enjoy this site!</p>
