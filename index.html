    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Who on Earth am I?</h2>
    <p>Greetings! My name is Ephram Matocha, I am a 14 year-old student based in Poole, Dorset. I am a big-time space
        fanatic so as a response to that I had an idea to make a website. So I have. I shall now move on to the aim of
        the website as well as content because this website isn't about
        me: its about space. It's all about space.</p>
    <h2>The Higher Purpose of this Humble Website</h2>
    <p>With the help of a good friend, I created this website with the aim to help teach certain things that might not
        necessarily be taught (such as dyson spheres). My aim is to help educate people about all-things space-related
        that don't get taught in school. That's all from me for now. I hope you enjoy this site!</p>
    <h1>Space Doughnuts with a Coating of Stellar Energy</h1>
    <p>This paper will attempt to explain a revolutionary idea that was promoted by a key scientist.

    <p>Warning: I will not take any responsibility for any headaches caused by any difficult concepts written in this
        informational text. </p2>

    <h2>What On Earth Is A Dyson Sphere?</h2>

    <p>Firstly, a Dyson sphere is not located on Earth. It is a hypothetical megastructure that would be used to obtain
        unlimited energy using the Sun. As far-fetched as it seems, this is a very real concept. In fact, it has been
        quite
        the hit, only with the sci-fi community that is. Spoiler: production of these megastructures won't happen until
        very
        far into the future. Building a stable Dyson Sphere is currently beyond humanity's engineering capacity. The
        number
        of craft required to obtain, transmit and maintain the structure exceeds present-day industrial capacities. Here
        is
        a picture of how a Dyson sphere would look, although there are many variations on the design idea (more on that
        later!).</p>

    <h2>History of This Concept</h2>

    <p>The person accredited for formalising this concept is Freeman Dyson (not the person who founded Dyson Ltd, that's
        James Dyson!) but he is not the first person to come up with the idea of a megastructure that uses the Sun's
        energy.
        The first person to have this idea is Olaf Stapleton who wrote a science-fiction novel called Star Maker. There
        is a
        section of the book that Freeman credits as the source of his concept. He even suggested calling Dyson spheres,
        Stapleton spheres instead. In 1960, Dyson wrote a paper called “Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of
        Infra-Red
        Radiation'' in which he outlined his hypothesis for a stellar-sized piece of architecture.</p>

    <h2>Variations Of Dyson Spheres</h2>

    <p>There are several variations of how a dyson sphere should look like due to several design flaws discovered over
        the
        years. At first, Dyson suggested that a dyson sphere would be a solid shell built around a star. After facing
        some
        criticism for the design idea, he replied with, “A solid shell or ring surrounding a star is mechanically
        impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which I envisaged consists of a loose collection or swarm of objects
        travelling
        on independent orbits around the star.” After Freeman said this, his concept made more sense and subsequently
        led to
        some creative design ideas. </p>

    <h3>Dyson Swarm</h3>

    <p>The notion of a Dyson swarm is the one that's closest to Freeman's idea of a biosphere that would be used to
        harness
        the Sun's energy. As the name suggests, a dyson swarm is composed of many independent objects (solar power
        satellites or space habitats) travelling each in their own separate orbit. Wireless energy transmission could be
        used to transfer energy between each component. There are two types of dyson swarm: a basic Dyson swarm which
        was
        what was just described in the sentences above and a complex Dyson swarm which works by having more than one
        ring of
        independent objects. However, this poses a risk of leading to a loss of orbital stability. </p>


    Above: The outline of a simple Dyson swarm aka a Dyson ring.





    Above: The design of a complex Dyson swarm, it has more layers of independent objects.

    <h3>Dyson Bubble</h3>

    <p>This type of dyson sphere design is an arrangement of statites (artificial satellites that travel freely instead
        of
        travelling in an orbit). These statites would be arranged at a uniform distance from the star. There would be no
        issue of collision with the star because they would be completely stationary. </p>

    <h3>Dyson Shell</h3>

    <p>This is the most popular choice of Dyson sphere design but also the most problematic. It is a solid shell of
        matter
        that encompasses the Sun as well as Mercury, Venus and Earth. Here is a picture to show the design. </p>

    <p>As you can see, the structure would span from the Sun to the Earth (which is the same as 1 astronomical unit or
        AU).
        For those who haven't realised yet, that image is not to scale. The shell is designed to trap a 100% of the
        Sun's
        energy output - that's (big number warning) 3.846 x 1026 watts (or 384600000000000000000000000 as an ordinary
        number). There are obviously some ethical issues with trapping 100% of the Sun's energy such as cutting off
        sunlight
        to the rest of the planets in the solar system and messing with the Sun's gravitational pull. Now
        hypothetically, if
        we did have the resources to build this, there would be other issues such as meteor and comet collisions with
        the
        wall of the structure which if did enough damage could have a catastrophic effect on the solar system. Message
        to
        any sci-fi enthusiasts: I really discourage you from believing that this is what a Dyson sphere would end up
        looking
        like because out of all of the design plans this one is the most problematic, unethical and also the one that
        would
        require the most material to build it.</p>

    <h3>Other Variatioons</h3>

    <p>There have been some other less-known ideas proposed for the appearance of a Dyson sphere. This one is quite
        far-fetched but there has been a concept of a 'dyson net'. Now how this functions is by having a web of cables
        strung about the Sun that could have heat or power collection packs between the cables. The Dyson net would
        reduce
        to a special type of Dyson shell or bubble. At the moment, there isn't enough information about this blueprint
        so
        I'll have to move on to the next one. The next idea which is quite impractical is a proposed 'Bubbleworld' which
        would be a shell of living space around a sphere of hydrogen gas which would contain air, people, furniture,
        houses
        etc. However most of the area around the Sun is uninhabitable so this option is not possible. The next variants
        of
        the Dyson sphere appearance will require a sub-heading of their own. You will see why in a minute. </p>

    <h3>Tongue-Twisting Technologies: Matrioshka Brains, Shkadov Thrusters and Nicoll-Dyson Beams </h3>

    <p>The reason these have a separate sub-heading is because they are not variants on the appearance but instead an
        alternate use of the Dyson sphere (an upgrade essentially). Matrioshka brains rely on the Dyson shell design as
        it
        absorbs the full power output of the Sun. I shall now help explain to you what a matrioshka brain is. Imagine a
        computer. Now imagine one in the shape of a giant sphere. Now imagine that giant sphere to be 1AU (one
        astronomical
        unit is generally the distance between the Earth and the Sun which varies due to the maximum distance called
        aphelion and the minimum distance called perihelion) big. Got that? Yes or no? If not, then let me make more
        sense.
        A matrioshka brain is a super-sized computer that uses several Dyson spheres. There would be one smaller dyson
        sphere in the very middle which draws in the energy directly from the Sun. However this would give off lots of
        waste
        energy which would then be absorbed by the second Dyson sphere. Any waste energy from that would be a third
        Dyson
        sphere and so on and so forth.</p>

    <p>Next up is the Shkadov thruster. Yes, you heard me correctly, there's more to come. A Shkadov thruster is a Class
        A
        stellar engine that accelerates a star by selectively reflecting or absorbing light on one side of the star's
        surface. In order to function properly, the thruster would need a Dyson sphere. Therefore, it is another
        variation
        on the use of a Dyson sphere. To simplify what a Shkadov thruster does is basically with these stellar engines
        we
        could move our Sun if it ever was in danger of a catastrophic event. Now, it's time to get technical. The Dyson
        sphere would be connected to an enormous mirror or light sail form of a statite (mashup of the words static and
        satellite) that would continuously alter its orbit in ways gravity could never affect (bear in mind this is all
        hypothetical so I can't explain how this would be possible).This would hypothetically balance gravitational
        attraction towards and radiation pressure away from the star. Since the radiation pressure of the star would now
        be
        asymmetrical (lacking symmetry so this means that one side would have produce more radiation pressure than the
        other). This imbalance of radiation pressure would produce an effect that would lead to the star having thrust.
        Such
        thrust and acceleration would be very slight, but such a system could be stable for millennia. Any planetary
        system
        attached to the star would be 'dragged' along by its parent star. Here is an example of the maths involved with
        this. The Sun (which has a luminosity of 3.85 x 1026 watts and a mass of 1.99 x 1030 kilograms), if it was to be
        moved it would produce 1.28x1018 Newtons worth of thrust if half of the solar output was reflected. After one
        million years of moving at a constant rate of 20m/s it would have moved 0.03 lightyears (2.84 x 1011
        kilometres).
        After a billion years, the Sun would have moved 34000 lightyears (3.22 x 1017 kilometres). That should hopefully
        cover shkadov thrusters. Oh, I think there's still some more about them I haven't mentioned yet. So, Shkadov
        thrusters also have this cool feature. No they don't. I'm just kidding. We are finished with this
        headache-of-a-Dyson-sphere variant. However, there is still one more left. It's not as complicated though, don't
        worry.</p>

    <p>The item left in the list is none other than the Nicoll-Dyson beam. This would be a hypothetical defence
        mechanism of
        a Dyson sphe000000000000000000000000000000000000000000re that uses satellites in a Dyson swarm (yes that's the
        very
        same Dyson swarm I talked about earlier) to deliver a lethal energy payload to an object millions of light years
        away (the only problem with this is that this would take an insane amount of time unless we could bend
        space-time so
        that the laser would be faster than the speed of light). The only non-deadly way that these could be used would
        be
        to propel laser-craft interstellar distances. That's all, folks. You have successfully finished this section of
        this
        paper. I now present some pictures that depict all three of the things I have just spoken to you in detail
        about.

    graphs regarding stellar engines. I bet you're happy I chose this one instead.

    <h2>The Search for Dyson Spheres </h2>

    <p>There have been many speculations that there are Dyson spheres out there in between the stars, waiting to be
        discovered. Freeman Dyson suggested in his original paper that in order to be able to build a megastructure that
        uses a star's energy output, a civilisation would have to be a Type II on the Kardashev scale (this will be
        covered
        in the next section, don't worry). Several organisations have already started searches for Dyson spheres, all of
        which have been unsuccessful so far. However, before I tell you about these failed missions, I think it would be
        rather helpful if I established the key features of a Dyson sphere the organisations used to identify whether a
        star
        was a star or a megastructure. The first thing that would make a Dyson sphere different from a star is the light
        emitted. By looking at the emission spectra (spectrum of electromagnetic radiation released by an object), we
        would
        be able to look at what the output of stars generally is then look for any anomalies. Specifically, what
        scientists
        have figured out is that there would be an increase in infra-red radiation. If the Dyson sphere was made by
        materials to those we have classified, it would be possible to determine that there would be a higher amount of
        infra-red radiation reradiated in the star's system emitted spectrum. Now, onto the case studies. There are two
        main
        organisations that have held searches for these megastructures. The first one is Fermilab. From 2005 they have
        had
        an ongoing survey that has looked for Dyson spheres using data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)
        out
        of which they have found 17 possible candidates. They have admitted that identifying a Dyson sphere would
        require
        more advanced techniques for distinguishing between natural sources and the actual objects in question. The next
        organisation to launch a search is Planet Hunters. On October 14th 2015, they discovered puzzling fluctuations
        in a
        star called KIC 8462852 (aka Tabby's Star - named after the scientist who was the initial study's lead author).
        Unfortunately, further analysis in 2017 disproved the idea that the object was a Dyson sphere because it gave
        out
        very little amounts of dust, so therefore it couldn't be an opaque object that would block all wavelengths of
        light.
        We are now moving on to another section. </p>

    <h2>The Link Between Megastructures and the Kardashev Scale</h2>

    <p>To simplify what the title of this section means, basically the following paragraph will link to why we are very
        far
        away from being advanced enough to build megastructures that use the Sun's energy. I should probably first
        introduce
        what the Kardashev scale is. It is a method of classifying how advanced civilisations are based on the amount of
        energy they use. A Russian astrophysicist called Nikolai Kardashev identified 3 types of civilisation: a
        civilisation that would able to harness all of the energy found on their home planet, a civilisation that would
        be
        able to harness all of the energy from the star in their planetary system and one that would be able to harness
        all
        of the energy in their galaxy. The only two relevant types are Type I and Type II. In order to be able to build
        Dyson spheres, humanity would have to become a Type II civilisation. Carl Sagan developed an equation that
        helped us
        calculate where we are on this scale. For anyone interested in what the equation is, here it is:

        Let me explain what these letters mean: P is equal to the number on the Kardashev scale, P is equal to the power
        the
        civilisation uses in Watts. In 2019, the total world energy consumption was 581.51 exajoules, equivalent to
        18.44
        terawatts (TW) or 0.73 on the scale. We still have a long way to go until we'll be able to construct such
        megastructures. Firstly, we'd need to transcend into a Type I civilisation, then from there into a Type II
        civilisation. That's why Dyson spheres will only remain a hypothetical idea for the time being, and not anything
        feasible. We are now heading towards the end of this essay. I present to you the penultimate section: ethical
        issues. </p>

    <h2>Ethical Issues</h2>

    <p>I have talked about a lot of positive things about Dyson spheres but so far I have failed to mention the reasons
        for
        why we shouldn't go ahead with this idea.
        Firstly, using the Sun for its energy could have a very negative impact on the Solar System. For example, if we
        made
        a single flaw in the design of the structure, it could end up colliding with the Sun, causing a catastrophic
        explosion that could do more than just cause the Dyson sphere to blow up. Just imagine how disastrous that would
        be.
        Next, I know I've already mentioned this previously but it is an ethical issue. If we were to settle on the
        Dyson
        shell idea, it would have an effect that would destroy our system as we know it. Planets, without having the
        sunlight they need, would be thrown into chaos. The next issue that I have identified is that by the time we
        become
        a Type II civilisation, we would need to stop having all conflict whatsoever between each other. War is
        something
        that would have to be eradicated. If we would want to 'manage' a star, we would have to ensure that we could do
        so
        without any threats of internal conflict, which if it went to the extreme, would lead us to our own
        annihilation. If
        we carry on like we are now, Dyson spheres will not be used to power humanity but used to power weapons of mass
        annihilation that could eradicate planets, stars or worse, even galaxies. However, let's not get carried away
        here.
        We still have thousands of years to change our ways for the better. Now, the last problem that I have identified
        (there could be more that either I haven't discovered or thought of yet or just haven't been identified by
        anyone
        yet) is where we would get the materials for a Dyson sphere. A popular idea is that we could mine on Mercury to
        get
        the necessary metals we need to begin constructing the megastructure. This would mean mining Mercury to the very
        core because that's how many materials we need. Essentially, we would have to strip a planet of its very value
        in
        order to transcend into the next civilisation type. This is where it gets philosophical. It also leads to two
        questions that may be posed: “How many planets would we have to sacrifice in order to build a Dyson sphere?” and
        “Will it be worth it in the long run?” As much as I love these megastructures, I can't help but feel conflicted
        at
        the idea of planets being exploited just so that we can build something that might not even work. I will let you
        as
        readers form your own opinions, though, as it is a dilemma that only the future holds the answers for. We are
        now
        carrying on our journey to one last section. </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>You cannot have an information text without a summary, so here it is. I will break down each section into key
        bullet
        points that wrap up everything I have said nicely in a bow.</p>
    <h3>Section One: What on Earth is a Dyson Sphere?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that would use the Sun's energy to power civilisation.</li>
        <li>It is currently beyond the technological and industrial abilities of humans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Section Two: History</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The idea of a megastructure first appeared in Olaf Stapleton's book Star Maker in 1928.</li>
        <li>This concept was promoted in Freeman Dyson's paper, “Search for Artificial Stellar Resources of Infrared
            Radiation”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 3: Variations</h3>
    <ul><li>Dyson swarm: a huge amount of either satellites or solar habitats travelling around the Sun. There are two
        variants of a Dyson swarm: the Dyson (Niven) ring and a complex Dyson swarm.</li>
        <li>Dyson bubble: statites arranged around a star that hover instead of having an orbit. There would be no risk of a
            collision between the objects and the Sun.</li>
        <li>Dyson shell: most popular design (especially in sci-fi culture) but also the most problematic.The biggest of all
            of the designs, it would be the size of the distance between the Sun and the Earth. This variation would be used to
            take in all of the Sun's energy. Subsequently, it also requires the most material to build it.</li>
        <li>Other variants: the Dyson net and the 'Bubbleworld'. The Dyson net is a web of cables that could have heat or
            power collection packs in between. It would reduce to a type Dyson shell or bubble. The 'Bubbleworld' would be a shell
            ofliving space that would contain air, people, buildings etc. However, most of the space around the Sun is
            uninhabitable so this would not be possible.</li>
        <li>Matrioshka brain: A matrioshka brain is a super-computer that uses several Dyson spheres to power it. There
            would be a Dyson sphere in the middle, then a bigger one around it and then another and so on and so forth. This variant
            is named after the Russian matryoshka dolls.</li>
        <li>Shkadov thruster: A stellar engine that uses an enormous statite in the form of a mirror or light sail. It would
            be constantly changing its orbit so that the Sun's gravity doesn't pull it in. This would make one side have
            gravitational attraction and the other to have radiation pressure. The asymmetrical radiation pressure would
            have an effect that would lead to thrust. Given that the Sun has a luminosity 3.85 x 10 to the power of 26 watts and a mass of 1.99 x
            10 to the power of 30 kilograms, it would produce 1.28 x 10 to the power of 18 Newtons worth of thrust if half of the solar output was reflected. If it
            moved at a constant rate of 20m/s (1728 kilometres per day), it would move 0.03 lightyears in a million years.</li>
        <li>Nicoll-Dyson Beam: a proposed defence mechanism of a Dyson sphere. It would use the Sun's energy to deliver a
            deadly laser. Another use of this could be to help propel laser-craft. </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Section 4: The Search for Dyson Spheres</h3>
    <ul><li>There have been several organisations that have searched for Dyson spheres.</li>
       <li>The main key feature that distinguishes megastructures from stars is a higher amount of infra-red radiation in
        the emission spectra.</li> 
        <li>The main key feature that distinguishes megastructures from stars is a higher amount of infra-red radiation in
            the emission spectra.</li>
       <li> The first organisation to look for Dyson spheres is Fermilab.</li>
        <li>In 2005, they started their search using data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) from which they
            found 17 possible candidates.</li>
        <li>Fermilab admitted they would require more advanced techniques to find Dyson spheres.</li>
       <li> The next organisation to search for megastructures was Planet Hunters.</li>
        <li>On October 14th 2015, they found strange fluctuations in the star KIC 8462852, eventually called Tabby's star.</li>
        <li>Further studies disproved that it was a Dyson sphere because it was found to give out very small amounts of
            dust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 5: The Link Between Megastructures and the Kardashev Scale</h3>
    <ul><li>The Kardashev scale is a scale developed by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev that classes civilisations
        based on their energy use.</li>
        <li>He identified 3 types of civilisations.</li>
        <li>Type I: a civilisation that is able to harness all the energy from their home planet.</li>
        <li>Type II: a civilisation that is able to harness all the energy from their star.</li>
        <li> Type III: a civilisation that is able to harness all the energy found in their galaxy.</li>
        <li> Carl Sagan developed an equation that helps identify where are on this scale.</li>
        <li>In 2019, it was discovered that we are 0.73 on the scale.</li>
        <li>In order to build Dyson spheres, we'd have to be a Type II civilisation.</li>
       <li> We still have a long way to go until we'll be able to do such things.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Section 6: Ethical issues</h3>
    <ul><li>In order to have a successful Dyson sphere we would have to make sure that there are no flaws in the plan
        because the tiniest error could lead us to our downfall.</li>
        <li>By the time we would be able to build these megastructures we would have to make sure that we've stopped having
            conflict between each other.</li>
       <li> If a corrupt person was in charge of the Dyson sphere, it would lead to internal conflict that would lead to
        weapons being used and these weapons could damage an important part of the structure that would end up killing us all if
        the Dyson sphere explodes.</li>
        <li>If we don't change our ways by the time we will have the technological capabilities for this, Dyson spheres'
            sole use will just be weapons of mass annihilation.</li>
        <li>If the Dyson shell design is used, essential sunlight will be cut off for all the planets in our solar system.</li>
       <li> A popular idea of how we would get the materials for this would be to mine on Mercury.</li>
        <li>This would mean we would basically strip mercury of all of its metal because that's how much we need to build a
            Dyson sphere.</li>
        <li>This leads to two philosophical questions that could be asked when we get to this stage.</li>
        <li>They are: “How many planets would we have to sacrifice in order to build a Dyson sphere?” and “Will it be worth
            it in the long run?”</li>
       <li> We will need to set limits for how many planets we will destroy in order to construct the megastructure.</li> 
    </ul>
